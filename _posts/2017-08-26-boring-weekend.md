title: Every boring weekend
---

I always plan to study some awesome code on the internet,
but every weekend when I got home, I open the computer
only to browse social network, watch movies and listener music.
Or sleep to midnight.

Looking at my graph of contribution frequency, I will always feel
guilty. I just lost interests in coding during weekend.

I sometimes tell myself that you should write some more packages for your favorite text editor or some npm packages for the js community. It is good for you. But the fact is, I was so lazy on weekends.

In order to keep the graph being full, I wrote this article.
